# `mp-sequencer` client

The web app for `mp-sequencer`. The front-end app only is available at https://mp-sequencer.surge.sh. As the back-end app needs to be run from a local computer with Max and Ableton running, it is no longer online. Instead, an archive of the livestream is included on the page.

## Development

To develop, run `yarn start`. To build a static copy, run `yarn build`.
